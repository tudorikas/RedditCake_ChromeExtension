Google Chrome Extension - Displays the date each account was created that posted comments on a Reddit page.
Starting with the idea that most new accounts that post comments tend to be bots or malicious people who post fake news, this extension helps the user to notice more easily which accounts are new.


You can modify the list with subreddits with right click on the extension Icon -> Options.
